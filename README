This project uses PHP and MySQL. In order to work this website locally you need to have a private server with those environments. For Mac OS X, a common one is XAMPP.

In your MySQL server source the "setup.sql" file.
	mysql> source /Where/You/Downloaded/Github/Files/Anewalt_Project/setup.sql

Once that's done, navigate to "localhost/Anewalt_Project/login.php"
